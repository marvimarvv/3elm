    "story text": "I have always been deeply invested in the latest breakthroughs and Nobel Prize-winning discoveries. However, I have often found that when I wished to share such articles with my greatest supporter in life, my grandmother, there was either a lack of availability in the Arabic language or the content was limited to dense research papers. It is with great enthusiasm that I announce the birth of 3ELM, a project that was made possible through the unwavering support of my partners and family. This is the future of scientific content in the Arabic language."
